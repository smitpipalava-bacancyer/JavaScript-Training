when i do this stuff 
let num = document.getElementById("User_Num").value;

and runs the logic to check whether the number is +ve , -ve or 0 then it didn't run.

Reason :-

when browser render the html page at that time js is also rendered and it reads the value from the input value and then it stores "" in the num...

so when i run the if else or switch case then the condition looks like this

"" == 0 
"" > 0
"" < 0 

and same it for the switch case ...


NOTE :- JavaScript does not auto-update variables when the DOM changes.








-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One more thing is that suppose we take the input type="text" 

then first we need to convert it into the number so for that there are 2 methods ...

let x = Number(num.value);
let x = parseInt(num.value);
